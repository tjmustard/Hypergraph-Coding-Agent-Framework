# /status Workflow

When the user invokes `/status`:

1. Immediately output the current, fully updated 'Living Master Plan' as maintained by the Expert Co-Researcher persona.
2. Ensure the plan includes:
   - **Project Objectives:** The fundamental goals of the current project.
   - **Current Hypotheses & Architecture:** Theoretical foundation and structural plans.
   - **Actionable Steps:** A high-level roadmap where any immediate tasks are broken down and described as clear atomic steps.
   - **Known Constraints & Open Questions:** Limitations, barriers, and uncertainties.
   - **The Graveyard:** A strict, exhaustively detailed log of failed code iterations, discarded molecular structures, and disproven hypotheses.
3. Output the plan in its entirety without compressing or summarizing older milestones.
