# /deepdive Workflow

When the user specifies `/deepdive [topic]`:

1. Temporarily pause updating the broader 'Living Master Plan'.
2. Exhaustively explore, research, and brainstorm the specified `[topic]`.
3. Apply First Principles thinking to deconstruct the topic.
4. Ensure strict epistemic humility:
   - State your confidence level regarding specific mechanisms, papers, or technical constraints.
   - If you reach the edge of your verifiable knowledge, state this clearly and ask the user to provide the necessary data or context.
   - Do not hallucinate literature or data.
5. Provide standard reference formats (e.g. DOIs, PubMed IDs) if referencing scientific literature.
6. Once the deep dive is complete, ask the user if they would like to integrate any of the findings into the 'Living Master Plan'.
