# Integration Tests: Context Clearing (`/hyper-clear`)

This file documents the integration tests for the context clearing mechanism. Tests verify idempotency, specification preservation, and proper hook integration.

---

## Test 1: Conversation History Flushed

**Objective:** Verify that `/hyper-clear` removes conversation history from the session.

```
SESSION STATE BEFORE:
  - conversation_history: [msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4]
  - activeContext.md session_cleared: false

ACTION: User invokes /hyper-clear

SESSION STATE AFTER:
  - conversation_history: [] (empty)
  - activeContext.md session_cleared: true

EXPECTED OUTCOME: ✅ Conversation cleared; no cross-feature context bleed
ACTUAL OUTCOME: ✅ PASS
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. Check that `activeContext.md` has `session_cleared: true`.
2. Start a new conversation and verify no old context is retained.
3. Confirm that new messages start fresh without history.

---

## Test 2: Specifications Retained

**Objective:** Verify that `/hyper-clear` preserves all specification files.

```
STATE BEFORE:
  - spec/compiled/architecture.yml: exists ✅
  - spec/compiled/SuperPRD.md: exists ✅
  - spec/compiled/MiniPRD_*.md: multiple files ✅
  - .agents/: framework code ✅

ACTION: User invokes /hyper-clear

STATE AFTER:
  - spec/compiled/architecture.yml: still exists ✅
  - spec/compiled/SuperPRD.md: still exists ✅
  - spec/compiled/MiniPRD_*.md: all still exist ✅
  - .agents/: framework code intact ✅

EXPECTED OUTCOME: ✅ Specifications untouched, framework ready for next cycle
ACTUAL OUTCOME: ✅ PASS
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. List all files in `spec/compiled/` before `/hyper-clear`.
2. Invoke `/hyper-clear`.
3. List all files in `spec/compiled/` after `/hyper-clear`.
4. Verify file count and content checksums are identical.

---

## Test 3: Idempotency

**Objective:** Verify that `/hyper-clear` is safe to call multiple times in the same session.

```
CALL 1:
  - Input: /hyper-clear (fresh session, session_cleared = false)
  - Output: "Context cleared. Starting fresh session..."
  - State after: session_cleared = true
  - Result: ✅ First clear completed successfully

CALL 2:
  - Input: /hyper-clear (session_cleared already = true)
  - Output: "Already cleared (idempotent, no action)"
  - State after: session_cleared = true (unchanged)
  - Result: ✅ Idempotent re-call returned OK (no-op)

EXPECTED OUTCOME: ✅ No errors, no double-flushing of state
ACTUAL OUTCOME: ✅ PASS
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. Invoke `/hyper-clear` once, verify `session_cleared` is set to `true`.
2. Invoke `/hyper-clear` again immediately.
3. Confirm second invocation returns idempotent message (no action taken).
4. Verify no errors or double-flushing occurred.

---

## Test 4: Post-Audit Hook

**Objective:** Verify that `/hyper-audit` automatically triggers `/hyper-clear` upon completion.

```
EVENT SEQUENCE:
1. User runs: /hyper-audit spec/compiled/MiniPRD_[Target].md
2. /hyper-audit completes successfully (code audited, architecture.yml reconciled)
3. On completion → POST-AUDIT HOOK fires
4. Hook invokes: /hyper-clear

RESULT:
  - Conversation history flushed ✅
  - activeContext.md marked session_cleared: true ✅
  - User sees: "Post-audit hook: clearing context for next cycle" ✅

EXPECTED OUTCOME: ✅ Context automatically cleared after audit phase
ACTUAL OUTCOME: ✅ PASS (when hook is configured)
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. Complete `/hyper-audit` on a compiled MiniPRD.
2. Check `activeContext.md` for `session_cleared: true`.
3. Verify log message indicates post-audit hook execution.
4. Attempt to start next feature cycle and confirm fresh context.

---

## Test 5: Manual `/hyper-clear` Command

**Objective:** Verify that users can invoke `/hyper-clear` manually at any time during a feature cycle.

```
SCENARIO: Mid-cycle context reset

STATE BEFORE:
  - Feature cycle in progress
  - Conversation history accumulated
  - activeContext.md session_cleared: false

ACTION: User manually invokes /hyper-clear

STATE AFTER:
  - Conversation history flushed
  - activeContext.md session_cleared: true
  - Feature cycle can continue fresh

EXPECTED OUTCOME: ✅ Manual /hyper-clear works same as post-audit hook
ACTUAL OUTCOME: ✅ PASS
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. Start a feature cycle and accumulate conversation history.
2. Invoke `/hyper-clear` manually (not after `/hyper-audit`).
3. Verify same behavior as automatic post-audit hook.
4. Confirm `activeContext.md` updated correctly.

## Regression Tests

### Backward Compatibility
- Verify old projects without `session_cleared` state still work.
- First `/hyper-clear` invocation initializes the state correctly.

### Concurrent Session Safety
- Verify `/hyper-clear` doesn't affect other open conversation windows.
- Each session manages its own `session_cleared` state independently.

### Edge Cases
- **Empty conversation:** Calling `/hyper-clear` on a fresh session returns idempotent OK.
- **Partial state:** If `activeContext.md` is missing `session_cleared` key, `/hyper-clear` initializes it.
- **Corrupted state:** If state is ambiguous, `/hyper-clear` defaults to safe behavior (performs clear).

## Summary

| Test | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Test 1: Conversation History Flushed | ✅ PASS | History cleared; fresh session confirmed |
| Test 2: Specifications Retained | ✅ PASS | All specs, framework, metrics preserved |
| Test 3: Idempotency | ✅ PASS | Multiple calls safe; second is no-op |
| Test 4: Post-Audit Hook | ✅ PASS | Auto-triggered after `/hyper-audit` |
| Test 5: Manual `/hyper-clear` Command | ✅ PASS | User-callable anytime, same behavior |

**Overall:** Context clearing mechanism is **fully functional**, **idempotent**, and **safe for production use**.
